Displays images in a folder as a slideshow with 12 transition types to choose from.

Supports local files only. I suggest transfering the files from a computer using a USB connection.

Meant to find a use for older unsupported devices that are just sitting around. Accordingly the app does not have any networking features since these old devices are often inherently insecure.

Features:
- Display pictures of a local folder in a slideshow
- 12 slideshow transitions
- Customizable time before changing picture
- Option to scale the pictures to fit the screen
- Can randomize the picture order
